# JS-React-JS-Projects

âœ… Stone-Paper-Scissors Game (JS): Practiced using conditions and event handling while making a fun, interactive game.

âœ… Tic-Tac-Toe Game (JS): Learned how to manage game state, check win conditions, and update the UI dynamically.

âœ… Password Generator (React JS): A customizable tool where users can generate strong passwords with adjustable length, numbers, and special characters, helping me practice state management and component structuring in React.

These projects might look small, but they represent:
ðŸ”¹ Consistency in learning by building, not just consuming tutorials.
ðŸ”¹ Debugging skills and patience (fixing even small bugs felt like a big win).
ðŸ”¹ Confidence in understanding DOM manipulation, React hooks, and user interaction handling.

Letâ€™s keep building and learning! ðŸ’ªâœ¨
